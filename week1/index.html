    Hi Keisha, 

My name is Hyunjoo Lee, a current menswear/boyswear design assistant at Global Brands Group. In my current position, I assists design director and senior designer with visual research for seasonal concepts, design tech packs, color CAD's and linesheets. I track and confirm lab-dips, strike off and handloom approvals and communicate comments with oversea's factory.

I also have very keen eye with great work ethics and organization skills. I am an expert on Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop and Indesign as well as Microsoft programs including Excel and Powerpoint.
